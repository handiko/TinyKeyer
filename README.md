IAMBIC85: "An Ultra Simple Iambic Keyer with Speed Pot"

* For ATTiny85 ( or ATTiny45 )

No "misteries" here, in only 244 bytes of code !

* **Speed**: From about 12 wpm to 40 wpm

* **Iambic Mode**: Iambic "B" ( Yep ! Accu Keyer, you bet... )

* **Sidetone**: 700 HZ ( _fixed_ )

* **DC Source**: 5V @ .03A ( _30ma_ )

I loved to put all on **base** of my **Vibroplex Iambic Key**

( but it was **"stand alone"**, not the **ATTiny Board** on the Schematic )
