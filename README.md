IAMBIC85: "An Ultra Simple Iambic Keyer with Speed Pot"

* At 2019 Jun 29: Now for **ALL** ATTiny85 (45/25 and for a 13, too !)

No "misteries" here, in only 244 bytes of code !

* **Speed**: From about 12 wpm to 40 wpm

* **Iambic Mode**: Iambic "B" ( Yep ! Accu Keyer, you bet... )

* **Sidetone**: 500 HZ (_fixed_)

=> At 2019 Jul 18: Changed to 500 HZ pitch (that's more "real World" CW !)

* **DC Source**: 5V @ .03A ( _30ma_ )

=> At 2019 Jul 18: Using an **external** 78L05 (better Speed Pot range)

I loved to put all on **base** of my **Vibroplex Iambic Key**

My version was done with an **ATTiny 13** (not an **ATTiny85 Board** as in Schematic)

=> At 2019 Jul 18: PSE this modest work **IS NOT** for ANY PROFIT of ANYONE IN WORLD !
