IAMBIC85: "An Ultra Simple Iambic Keyer with Speed Pot"

* Now (29 Jun 2019): For ATTiny85/45/25 and for ATTiny 13 too !

No "misteries" here, in only 244 bytes of code !

* **Speed**: From about 12 wpm to 40 wpm

* **Iambic Mode**: Iambic "B" ( Yep ! Accu Keyer, you bet... )

* **Sidetone**: 700 HZ ( _fixed_ )

* **DC Source**: 5V @ .03A ( _30ma_ )

I loved to put all on **base** of my **Vibroplex Iambic Key**

My version was done with an **ATTiny 13** (not an **ATTiny85 Board** as in Schematic)

**Warning** !
